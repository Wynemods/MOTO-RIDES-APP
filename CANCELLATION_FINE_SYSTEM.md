# MOTO Rides - Cancellation Fine System

## ðŸš¨ Complete Cancellation Fine Implementation

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive cancellation fine system for the MOTO Rides application that enforces the 5 free cancellations rule and applies fines for excessive cancellations.

## âœ… System Overview

### **Rules Implemented:**
- **Free Cancellations**: 5 cancellations allowed per user
- **Fine Trigger**: From 6th cancellation onwards
- **Fine Amount**: 200 KSH
- **Fine Block**: Passenger cannot request rides until fine is paid
- **Reset**: Cancellation count resets after fine payment

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### **Backend Implementation:**

#### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Added to User table
cancellationCount: Int @default(0)
hasActiveFine: Boolean @default(false)
fineAmount: Decimal? @db.Decimal(10, 2)
finePaidAt: DateTime? @db.Timestamp(6)
```

#### 2. **CancellationFineService**
- **Core Logic**: Tracks cancellations and applies fines
- **Eligibility Check**: Validates if user can cancel rides
- **Fine Application**: Automatically applies 200 KSH fine after 5th cancellation
- **Payment Processing**: Handles fine payments via multiple methods
- **Account Management**: Blocks ride requests until fine is paid

#### 3. **API Endpoints**
- `GET /fine-payments/status` - Get user's fine status
- `POST /fine-payments/pay` - Pay cancellation fine
- `GET /fine-payments/cancellation-eligibility` - Check cancellation eligibility

#### 4. **Integration Points**
- **RidesService**: Checks fine status before allowing ride requests
- **EdgeCaseService**: Integrates with cancellation handling
- **PaymentsService**: Processes fine payments
- **NotificationsService**: Sends fine-related notifications

### **Frontend Implementation:**

#### 1. **FinePaymentModal Component**
- **Payment Methods**: M-Pesa, Card, Wallet, Cash
- **Fine Details**: Shows amount, cancellation count, and payment options
- **Status Display**: Real-time fine status and payment progress
- **User Experience**: Clear, intuitive payment flow

#### 2. **HomeScreen Integration**
- **Fine Warning**: Prominent warning when fine is active
- **Blocking Logic**: Prevents ride requests when fine is unpaid
- **Status Checking**: Real-time fine status monitoring
- **Payment Flow**: Seamless fine payment experience

#### 3. **API Service Methods**
- `getFineStatus()` - Retrieve user's fine information
- `payFine()` - Process fine payment
- `checkCancellationEligibility()` - Check if user can cancel

## ðŸ“± User Experience Flow

### **Step 1: Cancel Ride**
- User cancels a ride
- System records cancellation in passenger profile
- Cancellation count is incremented

### **Step 2: Check Cancellation Count**
- **Count < 5**: No fine, free cancellation
- **Count = 5**: Warning shown about next cancellation
- **Count > 5**: Fine automatically applied

### **Step 3: Apply Fine**
- System sets `has_active_fine = true`
- Assigns `fine_amount = 200 KSH`
- Sends notification to passenger
- Blocks new ride requests

### **Step 4: Block New Requests**
- Passenger cannot request new rides
- Clear alert: "You must clear your fine before booking again"
- Fine payment modal appears when trying to book

### **Step 5: Pay Fine**
- Passenger sees fine payment options
- Multiple payment methods available (M-Pesa, Cash, Card, Wallet)
- Payment processing through existing payment system
- Real-time payment status updates

### **Step 6: Account Restored**
- Fine is cleared from account
- Cancellation count resets to 0
- Passenger can request rides normally again
- Success notification sent

## ðŸ”§ Configuration

### **Fine System Settings:**
```typescript
const config = {
  freeCancellations: 5,        // Number of free cancellations
  fineAmount: 200,             // Fine amount in KSH
  currency: 'KSH',             // Currency
};
```

### **Payment Methods:**
- **M-Pesa**: Mobile money payment
- **Card**: Credit/debit card payment
- **Wallet**: In-app wallet payment
- **Cash**: Cash payment (immediate confirmation)
