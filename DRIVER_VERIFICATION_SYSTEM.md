## ðŸ“± User Experience Flow

### **Driver Verification Workflow:**

#### **Step 1: Registration**
- User registers as "Driver" or "Both"
- System creates driver profile with verification status "pending"
- User cannot switch to driver mode until verified

#### **Step 2: Document Upload**
- User accesses verification through role switch or profile
- Uploads required documents:
  - Government ID (required)
  - Driver's License (required)
  - Vehicle Registration (required)
  - Vehicle Insurance (optional)
- System validates document completeness

#### **Step 3: Admin Review**
- Documents submitted with status "under_review"
- Admin reviews documents and makes decision
- Admin can approve, reject, or request resubmission

#### **Step 4: Verification Result**
- **Approved**: User can now switch to driver mode
- **Rejected**: User must resubmit documents
- **Resubmission Required**: User uploads additional documents

#### **Step 5: Driver Mode Access**
- Once verified, user can switch to driver mode
- All driver services become available
- Real-time verification status monitoring
