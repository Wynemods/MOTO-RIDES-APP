# MOTO Rides - Dual Role Support System

## ðŸš€ Complete Dual Role Support Implementation

I have successfully implemented a comprehensive dual role support system for the MOTO Rides application, allowing users to register as both riders and drivers and switch between modes seamlessly.

## âœ… System Overview

### **Dual Role Features:**
- **Multiple Role Registration**: Users can register as 'Rider', 'Driver', or 'Both'
- **Role Switching**: Toggle between Rider Mode and Driver Mode with a single tap
- **Active Role Management**: Only one role active at a time with proper access control
- **Seamless Experience**: Smooth transitions between different service modes
- **Role Validation**: Automatic checking of role permissions and driver profile status

## ðŸ›  Technical Implementation

### **Backend Implementation:**

#### 1. **Database Schema Updates**
```sql
-- Updated User table
roles: UserRole[] @default([rider])           -- Array of available roles
activeRole: UserRole @default(rider)          -- Currently active role

-- UserRole enum
enum UserRole {
  rider
  driver
}
```

#### 2. **Role Switching Service**
- **RoleSwitchingService**: Core logic for managing multiple roles
- **Role Management**: Add, remove, and switch between roles
- **Access Validation**: Check if user can access specific role services
- **Driver Profile Validation**: Ensure driver profile is active for driver mode
- **Statistics**: Role switching analytics and reporting

#### 3. **API Endpoints**
- `GET /role-switching/status` - Get user's available roles and active role
- `POST /role-switching/switch` - Switch to a different active role
- `POST /role-switching/add-role` - Add a new role to user account
- `POST /role-switching/remove-role` - Remove a role from user account
- `GET /role-switching/can-access/:role` - Check role access permissions
- `GET /role-switching/stats` - Get role switching statistics

#### 4. **Updated Authentication**

- **JWT Tokens**: Include both roles and active role in authentication
- **Role Validation**: Automatic role checking on all protected endpoints
- **Driver Profile Integration**: Seamless driver profile validation

### **Frontend Implementation:**

- **Feature Display**: Show available features for each registration type
- **Validation**: Ensure proper role assignment and validation

## ðŸ“± User Experience Flow

### **Registration Options:**

#### **Option 1: Rider Only**
- User selects "Rider" during registration
- Gets access to rider services only
- Can add driver role later if needed

#### **Option 2: Driver Only**
- User selects "Driver" during registration
- Gets access to driver services only
- Can add rider role later if needed

#### **Option 3: Both Roles**
- User selects "Both" during registration
- Gets access to both rider and driver services
- Starts in rider mode by default
- Can switch between modes anytime

### **Role Switching Flow:**

#### **Step 1: Access Role Switch**
- User taps role switch button in profile or home screen
- System shows available roles and current active role

#### **Step 2: Select New Role**
- User selects desired role (rider or driver)
- System validates role availability and permissions

#### **Step 3: Role Validation**
- **For Driver Mode**: Checks if driver profile is active
- **For Rider Mode**: Always available if user has rider role
- **Error Handling**: Clear messages if role switch is not possible

#### **Step 4: Mode Switch**
- System updates active role in database
- User interface updates to show new mode
- All services now work in the selected mode

#### **Step 5: Service Access**
- **Rider Mode**: Access to ride requesting, fare calculation, etc.
- **Driver Mode**: Access to ride acceptance, earnings tracking, etc.
- **Automatic Validation**: All APIs check active role before allowing access
